## 09/02/2025 - @Timinator - Double quotes on Tech.io

In "Hello, World!", I was using double quotes inside a Python string surrounded by single quotes. This was inside the story I tell about the origin of the "Hello, World!" exercise. I was not able to get Tech.io to properly display the double quotes. Instead I am using unicode smart (curly) quotes inside Python strings that get displayed on Tech.io:

* Left double quote: `“` (U+201C)

* Right double quote: `”` (U+201D)
