| 08/31/2025 | @Timinator | In "Hello, World!", I was using double quotes inside a Python string surrounded by single quotes. This was inside the story I tell about the origin of the "Hello, World!" exercise. I was not able to get Tech.io to properly display the double quotes. For now, I switched to single quotes in the displayed text. |
