# Set Up Your Local Workspace

Before you can contribute to PySkillz, youâ€™ll need your own copy of the repository to work on. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Fork the PySkillz repository on GitHub

    * Go to the [PySkillz GitHub page](https://github.com/Timinator2000/PySkillz).

    * Click the Fork button in the top-right corner.

    * This creates your own copy of PySkillz under your GitHub account.

2. Make sure Git is installed locally

    * On most systems, you can check by opening a terminal and running:

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

    * If Git is not installed, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

    * ðŸ’¡ Tip: If you install Git on Windows, youâ€™ll also get Git Bashâ€”a lightweight terminal that makes running Git commands easier. This guide was written while using Git Bash.

3. Clone your fork to your local machine

    * Navigate to your new fork on GitHub.

    * Click the green Code button and copy the HTTPS URL.

    * Determine where you want your local copy to exist in your local file structure. In your terminal, navigate to that location.

    * In your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows), run:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-fork-url>
    ```

    * This creates a local copy of your forked repository that you can work in.

After completing these steps, youâ€™ll have your own local workspace connected to your GitHub fork. All of your changes will be made here before being submitted back to the main PySkillz project.

With the repository successfully cloned to your local machine, the next step is to examine its structure. Understanding the organization of files and directories is essential before you begin making contributions.
