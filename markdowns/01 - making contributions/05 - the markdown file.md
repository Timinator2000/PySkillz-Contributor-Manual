# Write Your Exercise Instructions (`.md` file)

Each exercise starts with a __Markdown file__ (`.md`) that serves as the __instructions page learners see__ when they see the exercise in the playground. Think of this file as your opportunity to guide learners: explain the problem, set expectations, and provide any helpful examples or hints.

# Required Header for PySkillz Team

At the very top of your `.md` file, include a short note for the PySkillz team so we know __where youâ€™d like this exercise to appear in the playground.__ This should specify:

* __Skill topic__ â€“ the __name of the markdown folder__ (e.g., `05 - loops`)

* __Skill group__ â€“ the __name of the exercise group file__ (without the `.md` extension, e.g., `loops-basic`)

* __Explanation of your choice (optional)__ - you may also include a short note explaining why you chose this topic and group. For example, you might write that the exercise builds on a previous concept, fits a specific skill level, or complements other exercises in the group.

Regarding skill topic and skill group, this could be:

* an __existing skill group__ inside an existing topic,

* a __new skill group__ inside an existing topic, or

* a __completely new topic and group__.

# Exercise Instructions

A good `.md` file typically includes:

* Title â€“ The name of the exercise (should match the folder/file name).

* Problem statement â€“ A clear, concise description of the task.

* Input/Output expectations â€“ What kind of data the learnerâ€™s code will receive, and what it should return or print.

* Example â€“ One concrete example of valid input/output.

* Hints or tips (optional) â€“ Only if needed; try not to give away the full solution.

## Best Practices

* âœ… Keep it __short and to the point__.  

* âœ… Use __code blocks__ for clarity.  

* âœ… __MOST IMPORTANTLY__, be consistent â€“ follow the same format as other exercises in the playground.

Once your `.md` file is ready, youâ€™ve given learners everything they need to understand the challenge. Next, youâ€™ll move on to the Python files.
