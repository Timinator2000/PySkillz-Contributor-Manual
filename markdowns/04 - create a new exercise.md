# Step 3: Start a New Exercise with the Template

Creating a new exercise from scratch is quick and easy thanks to the exercise template provided in the python-project folder. This template gives you a ready-made shell that includes all the required files.

```text
ğŸ“‚ python-project
    ğŸ“‚ ----new_exercises----
        ğŸ“‚ ----exercise_template----
            ğŸ—‹ exercise_name.md
            ğŸ—‹ exercise_name.py
            ğŸ—‹ exercise_name_solution.py
            ğŸ—‹ exercise_name_test.py
```

To create your own exercise:

1. Make a __full copy__ of the ----exercise_template---- folder inside the ----new_exercises---- folder.

2. Rename the copied folder and all of its files to match the name of your new exercise.

    * âœ… Use __underscores instead of spaces__ in file and folder names.

    * âœ… Keep file endings (`_solution.py`, `_test.py`) intact.

Your structure should now look something like this:

```
ğŸ“‚ python-project
    ğŸ“‚ ----new_exercises----
        ğŸ“‚ ----exercise_template----
            ğŸ—‹ exercise_name.md
            ğŸ—‹ exercise_name.py
            ğŸ—‹ exercise_name_solution.py
            ğŸ—‹ exercise_name_test.py
        ğŸ“‚ my_new_exercise
            ğŸ—‹ my_new_exercise.md
            ğŸ—‹ my_new_exercise.py
            ğŸ—‹ my_new_exercise_solution.py
            ğŸ—‹ my_new_exercise_test.py
```

With the folder and filenames in place, your exercise shell is ready. Now itâ€™s time to start filling in the files to bring your exercise to life.
