# Step 3: Start a New Exercise with the Template

Creating a new exercise from scratch is quick and easy thanks to the exercise template provided in the python-project folder. This template gives you a ready-made shell that includes all the required files.

```text
📂 python-project
    📂 ____new_exercises____
        📂 ____exercise_template____
            📄 exercise_name.md
            📄 exercise_name.py
            📄 exercise_name_solution.py
            📄 exercise_name_test.py
```

To create your own exercise:

1. Make a __full copy__ of the `____exercise_template____` folder inside the `____new_exercises____` folder.

2. Rename the copied folder and all of its files to match the name of your new exercise.

    * ✅ Use __underscores instead of spaces__ in file and folder names.

    * ✅ Keep file endings (`_solution.py`, `_test.py`) intact.

Your structure should now look something like this:

```
📂 python-project
    📂 ____new_exercises____
        📂 ____exercise_template____
            📄 exercise_name.md
            📄 exercise_name.py
            📄 exercise_name_solution.py
            📄 exercise_name_test.py
        📂 my_new_exercise
            📄 my_new_exercise.md
            📄 my_new_exercise.py
            📄 my_new_exercise_solution.py
            📄 my_new_exercise_test.py
```

With the folder and filenames in place, your exercise shell is ready. Now it’s time to start filling in the files to bring your exercise to life.
